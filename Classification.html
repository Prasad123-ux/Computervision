 <center> <h1>Classification of Computer</h1></center>
<b>mainly computer are classified into three parts they are following.</b>
 <b>
 <ol>
   <li>Analog Computer</li>
   <li>Digital Computer</li>
   <li>Hybrid Computer</li>
 </ol>

<div><h3> 1] Analog Computer</h3>

  
<p><strong>Analog computer</strong> any of a class of devices in which continuously variable physical quantities, such as electrical potential, fluid pressure, or mechanical motion, are represented in a way analogous to the corresponding quantities in the problem to be solved. The analog system is set up according to initial conditions and then allowed to change freely. Answers to the problem are obtained by measuring the variables in the analog model. See also digital computer.</p></div>

<center><small>Analog computer</small></center>
<div><p>This type of computer was works on the principle of measurement in which measurement is obtained in the form of analog.Such computers do not deal with numbers they just count continiousbphysical quantities like temperature,voltage,pressure,etc.
The best example of analog computer is petrol pump machine. Every analog computer which converts the flow of petrol into quantity and price of petrol.</div></p>
 
<div><h3>2] Digital computer:-</h3>
<p>A computer that operate using a information which is represented i digital form (0,1) known as <strong>digital computer </strong>process image, text,audio,video and animation into digital value.</p></div>

<div>
<p>
digital computer , any of a class of devices capable of solving problems by processing information in discrete form. It operates on data, including magnitudes, letters, and symbols, that are expressed in binary code—i.e., using only the two digits 0 and 1. By counting, comparing, and manipulating these digits or their combinations according to a set of instructions held in its memory, a digital computer can perform such tasks as to control industrial processes and regulate the operations of machines; analyze and organize vast amounts of business data; and simulate the behaviour of dynamic systems (e.g., global weather patterns and chemical reactions) in scientific research.</div></p>
<div><h3>3] Hybrid computer</h3>
<p>It is a mixing of analog and digital computer are used for making calculations and digital computer are used for storing that data into digital values.</p></div>
<center><img class="side-img" src="H.jpg.jpg">
</center><div><p>Hybrid computers are computers that exhibit features of analog computers and digital computers. The digital component normally serves as the controller and provides logical and numerical operations, while the analog component often serves as a solver of differential equations and other mathematically complex equations. The first desktop hybrid computing system was the Hycomp 250, released by Packard Bell in 1961.[1] Another early example was the HYDAC 2400, an integrated hybrid computer released by EAI in 1963.</div></p>
<div><p>In the 1980s, Marconi Space and Defense Systems Limited (under Peggy Hodges) developed their "Starglow Hybrid Computer", which consisted of three EAI 8812 analog computers linked to an EAI 8100 digital computer, the latter also being linked to an SEL 3200 digital computer.[3] Late in the 20th century, hybrids dwindled with the increasing capabilities of digital computers including digital signal processors.</div></p>
<b>Digital computers are subdevided into following types.<br></b></center>
<ol>
<li>Micro computer</li>
<li>Mini computer</li>
<li>Mainframe computer</li>
<li>super computer</li>
<li>server machine</li>
<li>work station</li>
</ol>
<center>
<div><h3>1]Micro Computer</h3>
<p>microcomputer, an electronic device with a microprocessor as its central processing unit (CPU).</div></p><center><img class="side-img" src="M.jpg.jpg"> <div><p>icrocomputer was formerly a commonly used term for personal computers, particularly any of a class of small digital computers whose CPU is contained on a single integrated semiconductor chip. Thus, a microcomputer uses a single microprocessor for its CPU, which performs all logic and arithmetic operations. The system also contains a number of associated semiconductor chips that serve as the main memory for storing program instructions and data and as interfaces for exchanging data of this sort with peripheral devices (e.g., keyboard, video display, and printer) and auxiliary storage units. The earliest microcomputers marketed in the mid-1970s contained a single chip on which all CPU, memory, and interface circuits were integrated.</div></p>
<div><h3>2] Mini computer</h3>
<p>minicomputer, computer that was smaller, less expensive, and less powerful than a mainframe or supercomputer but more expensive and more powerful than a personal computer.</div></p><img class="side-img" src="M1.jpg.jpg"><div><p> Minicomputers were used for scientific and engineering computations, business transaction processing, file handling, and database management. Minicomputers as a distinct class of computers emerged in the late 1950s and reached their peak in the 1960s and ’70s before declining in popularity in the 1980s and ’90s. Their niche was filled by more powerful personal computers, workstations, and small or midsize servers.</div></p>
<div><h3>3]Mainframe Computer</h3>
<p>A mainframe computer, informally called a mainframe or big iron,[1] is a computer used primarily by large organizations for critical applications like bulk data processing for tasks such as censuses, industry and consumer statistics, enterprise resource planning, and large-scale transaction processing. A mainframe computer is large but not as large as a supercomputer and has more processing power than some other classes of computers, such as minicomputers, servers, workstations, and personal computers. Most large-scale computer-system architectures were established in the 1960s, but they continue to evolve. Mainframe computers are often used as servers.</div></p>
<img class="side-img" src="M2.jpg.jpg">
<div><p>The term mainframe was derived from the large cabinet, called a main frame,[2] that housed the central processing unit and main memory of early computers.[3][4] Later, the term mainframe was used to distinguish high-end commercial computers from less powerful machines.[5</div></p>
<div><h3>4]Super computer</h3>
<p>supercomputer is a computer with a high level of performance as compared to a general-purpose computer. The performance of a supercomputer is commonly measured in floating-point operations per second (FLOPS) instead of million instructions per second (MIPS). Since 2017, there are supercomputers which can perform over 1017 FLOPS (a hundred quadrillion FLOPS, 100 petaFLOPS or 100 PFLOPS).[3]/</div></p><img class="side-img" src="M3.jpg.jpg">
<div><p>Since November 2017, all of the world's fastest 500 supercomputers run Linux-based operating systems.[6] Additional research is being conducted in the United States, the European Union, Taiwan, Japan, and China to build faster, more powerful and technologically superior exascale supercomputers.</div></p>

<div><p>Supercomputers play an important role in the field of computational science, and are used for a wide range of computationally intensive tasks in various fields, including quantum mechanics, weather forecasting, climate research, oil and gas exploration, molecular modeling (computing the structures and properties of chemical compounds, biological macromolecules, polymers, and crystals), and physical simulations (such as simulations of the early moments of the universe, airplane and spacecraft aerodynamics, the detonation of nuclear weapons, and nuclear fusion). They have been essential in the field of cryptanalysis.</div></p>
<div><p>Supercomputers were introduced in the 1960s, and for several decades the fastest were made by Seymour Cray at Control Data Corporation (CDC), Cray Research and subsequent companies bearing his name or monogram. The first such machines were highly tuned conventional designs that ran more quickly than their more general-purpose contemporaries. Through the decade, increasing amounts of parallelism were added, with one to four processors being typical. In the 1970s, vector processors operating on large arrays of data came to dominate. A notable example is the highly successful Cray-1 of 1976. Vector computers remained the dominant design into the 1990s. From then until today, massively parallel supercomputers with tens of thousands of off-the-shelf processors became the norm.</div></p>
<div><h3>5]Server Machine</h3>
 <p>computing, a server is a piece of computer hardware or software (computer program) that provides functionality for other programs or devices, called "clients". This architecture is called the client–server model. Servers can provide various functionalities, often called "services", such as sharing data or resources among multiple clients, or performing computation for a client. A single server can serve multiple clients, and a single client can use multiple servers. A client process may run on the same device or may connect over a network to a server on a different device.[1] Typical servers are database servers, file servers, mail servers, print servers, web servers, game servers, and application servers.</div></p><img class="side-img" src="M4.jpg.jpg"><div><p>Client–server systems are usually most frequently implemented by (and often identified with) the request–response model: a client sends a request to the server, which performs some action and sends a response back to the client, typically with a result or acknowledgment. Designating a computer as "server-class hardware" implies that it is specialized for running servers on it. This often implies that it is more powerful and reliable than standard personal computers, but alternatively, large computing clusters may be composed of many relatively simple, replaceable server components.</div></p>
 <div><h3>6]Work station</h3>
<p>A workstation is a special computer designed for technical or scientific applications. Intended primarily to be used by one person at a time, they are commonly connected to a local area network and run multi-user operating systems. The term workstation has also been used loosely to refer to everything from a mainframe computer terminal to a PC connected to a network, but the most common form refers to the class of hardware offered by several current and defunct companies such as Sun Microsystems, Silicon Graphics, Apollo Computer, DEC, HP, NeXT and IBM which opened the door for the 3D graphics animation revolution of the late 1990s.</div></p>
<img class="side-img" src="M5.jpg.jpg">
<div><p>Workstations offer higher performance than mainstream personal computers, especially with respect to CPU and graphics, memory capacity, and multitasking capability. Workstations are optimized for the visualization and manipulation of different types of complex data such as 3D mechanical design, engineering simulations (e.g., computational fluid dynamics), animation and rendering of images, and mathematical plots. Typically, the form factor is that of a desktop computer, consists of a high resolution display, a keyboard and a mouse at a minimum, but also offers multiple displays, graphics tablets, 3D mice (devices for manipulating 3D objects and navigating scenes), etc. Workstations were the first segment of the computer market to present advanced accessories and collaboration tools.</div></p><button><a href="generation.html">Prev</a></button>
