<body><h1>Input and output devices</h1>
<h2>Input devices</h2>
<center>
<div><h3>1]Keyboard</h3>
<p>A computer keyboard is an input device that allows a person to enter letters, numbers, and other symbols (together, these are called characters) into a computer. It is one of the most used input devices for computers. Using a keyboard is often called typing.</div></p><img class="side-img" src="K.jpg.jpg">
<div><p>A keyboard contains many mechanical switches or push-buttons called "keys". When one of these are pushed, an electrical circuit is closed, and the keyboard sends a signal to the computer that tells it what letter, number or symbol it would like to be shown on the screen. The computer then shows the character on the screen, usually at the place where the flashing text cursor is.</div></p>

<div><p>Besides entering characters, computer keyboards also have special keys that change the symbol (such as shift or caps lock) or give the computer special commands (such as the arrow keys, CTRL and ALT). Different computer operating systems use different special keys, or use them differently. Special commands can also be glizzie! activated through combinations of keys, called keyboard shortcuts. Some of the most common shortcuts on Windows programs are: Ctrl + C, to copy some text or a picture; Ctrl + V, to paste what was copied; and Ctrl + F, to find a certain word on a document or web page.</div></p>
<img class="side-img" src="K1.jpg.jpg">

<div><p>A keyboard can be joined to a computer using a wire, but can also be wireless (like those that use Bluetooth). Most wired 21st century keyboards connect to a USB socket on the computer, but older ones use a round, purple DIN connector.</div
</p><div>
<p>There are different types of keyboards. They can be based on the way the keys work; for example, laptops have keys that do not move a lot, because the keyboard has to be very thin in order to fit inside the laptop. On the other hand, video game players often like keyboards with keys that move a lot, so that they feel the key working. Gaming keyboards also need fast reaction times. In between these two types, an ergonomic keyboard is made to be easier for people to type for long periods of time, without hurting their hands or arms.</div></p>
<img class="side-img" src="K2.jpg.jpg">

<div><p>There are also different ways the keys on a keyboard are arranged, usually to deal with different regions and languages of the world. Most computer keyboards have the keys in six rows, but some laptops use only five or even four rows to save space. The most popular layout is called QWERTY, which is based on the first six letters on them. The QWERTY design was made so that the most common letters would not make the moving parts of a mechanical typewriter "jam", or stop working. Now, even though most people do not use typewriters anymore, the design stayed because people were used to it. Other layouts have been developed, for example the Dvorak keyboard, which puts the most common letters in the places that are easiest to reach.</div></p>
<div><h3>2] Mouse</h3>
<p>A computer mouse is an input device that is used with a computer. Moving a mouse along a flat surface can move the cursor to different items on the screen. Items can be moved or selected by pushing the mouse buttons (called clicking).[1] Today's mouse have two buttons, the left button and right button, with a scroll wheel in between the two. Today, many computer mouse use wireless technology and have no wire.</div></p>
<img class="side-img" src="S.jpg.jpg">
<div>
<p>There are many types of mouse. Optical mouse, wireless mouse, mechanical mouse, trackball mouse. A computer mouse is a handheld hardware input device that controls a cursor in a GUI and can move and select text, icons, files, and folders. For desktop computers, the mouse is placed on a flat surface such as a mouse pad or a desk and is placed in front of your computer. The picture to the right is an example of a desktop computer mouse with two buttons and a wheel. The mouse was originally known as the X-Y position Indicator for a display system and was invented by Douglas Engelbart in 1963 while working at Xerox PARC. However, due to Alto's lack of success, the first widely used application of the mouse was with the Apple Lisa computer.</div></p>

<div><p>Today this device is on virtually every computer. The primary function is to move the mouse pointer on the screen. The mouse pointer can be used for many actions on the computer. Clicking or double clicking an icon, folder, or other object will open a document or execute the program. Users can also move an icon, folder, or other object by clicking a mouse button and dragging the object with the mouse pointer. Pointing to an item on the screen means moving your mouse so the pointer appears to be touching the item. When you point to something, a small box often appears that describes the item.</div></p>
<div><p>On most computers, the user can move the mouse to move the cursor in the same direction.[6] To choose something that is on the screen, the user can move the cursor to it and "click" the left mouse button. The right button is used to open menus that are different depending on where the cursor is. The other mouse buttons can do different things, depending on the software. Most mice have two buttons to click.</div
></p>
<img class="side-img" src="S1.jpg.jpg">
<div><p>Most mice also have the "scroll wheel"â€”a small wheel found between the two main mouse buttons. The user can move the wheel back and forth to "scroll" through things like a website or folder. "Scrolling" means moving the words or pictures up or down on the screen, so another part of the page comes into view. The wheel can also be pressed, to click it like another button.</div></p>

<div><p>A mouse can also be connected to and used the same way with a laptop computer, but unlike a desktop computer, one does not have to be connected to use the laptop. This is because along with the keyboard, laptops have a built-in input device called a trackpad which does the same thing as a mouse. Similarly, tablet computers have a touchscreen as an input device, but some, like the Microsoft Surface and those that use Android, also work with mice.</div></p>
<div><h5><p>There are many different types of computer mice, but how do you decide which one is right for your needs? Read our buyer guide to find the best mouse for you.</div></p></h5>
<div
<p>When PCs first hit the market for consumers, the computer mouse was simple and had limited functions. Today, there are numerous types of computer mouse and trackball designs to fit every computing style. This guide will give you an overview of the various models and their chief benefits to a user.</div></p>

<h4>Wired Mouse</h4>
<img class="side-img" src="W.jpg.jpg">
<div><p>A wired mouse connects directly to your desktop or laptop, usually through a USB port, and transmits information via the cord. The cord connection provides several key advantages. For starters, wired mice provide fast response time, as the data is transmitted directly through the cable. They also tend to be more accurate than other designs. This can make wired models great for gamers, digital artists, and other users who rely on high accuracy.</div></p>

<h4>Wireless Mouse</h4>
<img class="side-img" src="W11.jpg.jpg">
<div><p>Wireless mice transmit radio signals to a receiver connected to your computer. The computer accepts the signal and decodes how the cursor was moved or what buttons were clicked. While the freedom or range with wireless models is convenient, there are some drawbacks. The decoding process, for instance, means that a wireless mouse is generally not as responsive to gestures as a wired mouse. Gamers in particular might find the lag frustrating. That said, there are specific wireless mice designed for gaming that address the latency issue in their design and have quicker response times. For most users, however, the lag or lost accuracy with a wireless model will be negligible.</div></p>


<div><h4>Logitech M100 USB Wired Mouse</h4>
<p>The Logitech Mouse M100 offers USB and PS/2 connections.</div></p>
<img class="side-img" src="L.jpg.jpg">

<div><h4>Bluetooth device</h4>
<p>Wireless mouse designs and Bluetooth mouse designs tend to look very similar, as neither need a wired connection to operate. Most wireless mice models use a dongle that connects to your PC, and the mouse communicates back and forth in that manner. A Bluetooth mouse, however, utilizes an internal Bluetooth connection on your PC, allowing you to connect the mouse to multiple devices at a time.</div></p>
<img class="side-img" src="B1.jpg.jpg">
<div><p>Keep in mind, however, that not all devices have Bluetooth connections. If your computer does not have an internal Bluetooth receiver, you can get USB receiver that can be plugged into your computer to use with your Bluetooth mouse and other Bluetooth devices.</div></p>

<div><h4>Trackball Mouse</h4>
<p>A trackball mouse looks a lot like an upside-down mouse. These mice feature a ball with sensors that move the cursor on the screen when the ball is moved with your thumb. A trackball generally requires less effort to move around than a wired or wireless mouse while also allowing for easier scrolling. That said, a mouse generally gives you more freedom of movement and faster response time, which makes non-trackball styles better for gaming and computing activities that require heavy mouse use.</p></div>
<img class="side-img" src="T.jpg.jpg">


<div><h4>Logitech m570 USB Wireless Trackball</h4>
<p>The Logitech M570 USB wireless trackball now sports an adjustable laser sensor, giving a wider range of cursor speeds and the perfect amount of control. </div></p>
<img class="side-img" src="LM.jpg.jpg">
<div><h4>Optical Mouse</h4>

<p>Technically, all mice are optical and take images thousands of times per second as the mouse is moved. Traditional mice track the X and Y coordinates of the peripheral. The true optical mouse uses a red or infrared LED light projected onto a surface to track movement by bouncing the light off the surface into a CMOS sensor, which converts the light particles into an electric current. The resulting analog data passes over 10,000 digital images each second. The result is smooth movement and accurate pointing on your display that doesn't require a mouse pad and even allows the mouse to work over a glass surface.</div></p>
<img class="side-img" src="O.jpg.jpg">


<div<h4>Laser Mouse</h4>
<p>Whether wired or wireless, an optical mouse and laser mouse are very much alike in design but have one key difference. While optical mice use infrared LED light to bounce off surfaces to track movement, laser mice utilize an LED outside the visible spectrum and appears to have no light at all. Both types perform well, but laser mice models tend to have a bit more accuracy. Either way, both mouse types are excellent choices for standard PC duties.</div></p><img class="side-img" src="PM.jpg.jpg"
<div><h4>Magic Mouse</h4>
<p>The Magic Mouse was first developed for use with Apple computers. It works much like a traditional PC mouse. However, Apple also created multitouch technology that allows for swiping and scrolling by moving your hand over the surface of the mouse. These features can make regular tasks more efficient. If youâ€™re a PC user, donâ€™t feel left out! Windows has developed compatible drivers that allow Magic Mouse models to work on a PC as well.</div></p>
<img class="side-img" src="AM.jpg.jpg">

<div><p>Apple Magic Mouse 2 - mouse - Bluetooth
The Apple Magic Mouse 2's multi-touch surface allows you to perform simple gestures such as swiping between web pages and scrolling through documents</div></p>

<div><h4>USB Mouse</h4>
<p>A USB mouse is one of the most common types of computer mice and has been a part of computer peripherals since the USB Standard was set in 1996. USB computer mice may be wired or wireless. The wired mouse plugs into a USB slot on your PC, while a wireless mouse usually has a transmitter that plugs into the USB slot and communicates with the mouse. These are good standard mice for all PC activities.</div></p>
<img class="side-img" src="usb.jpg.jpg">
<div><<h4>Vertical Mouse</h4>
<p>A vertical mouse is an ergonomic design that places the wrist in a "handshake" position rather than flat against a desk. This reduces the pressure on the underside of the wrist and the internal rotation of the shoulders. </div></p>
<img class="side-img" src="verticle.jpg.jpg"><div><p>The unique design can take some getting used to, but it may help reduce the chance of muscular stress-related conditions like carpal tunnel.</div></p>
<h4>Gaming Mouse</h4>

<img class="side-img" src="gaming.jpg.jpg">
<div><p>Gaming mice are available in both wired and wireless designs and may include additional features beyond standard models to improve your gaming experience. In general, these mice models are designed to do everything a normal mouse can do while offering higher accuracy, less latency, and more ergonomic designs.</div></p>

<div><p>Other key features that can be found with gaming mice are the inclusion of more buttons (which may be programmable for unique in-game use), flashy designs, DPI control, and customizable drivers that can be tailored to your specific gaming needs. Some gaming mouse models even have adjustable weights, which can make a difference when making repeated movements with your mouse over long gaming sessions. And, of course, you can still use your gaming mouse for non-gaming day-to-day activities as well.</div></p>

<div><p>Find the Best Mouse for Your Needs
There are many types of computer mouse and trackball designs on the market today. From mice designed with ergonomics in mind to lightning-fast gaming mice and standard USB mice for daily computing activities, there is a mouse to fit your needs. Consider the types of daily tasks you do to narrow down the best mouse for your own computing needs.</div>

<div><h3>3] Scanner</h3>
<p>A scanner is a device that captures images from photographic prints, posters, magazine pages, and similar sources for computer editing and display. Scanners come in hand-held, feed-in, and flatbed types and for scanning black-and-white only, or color. Very high resolution scanners are used for scanning for high-resolution printing, but lower resolution scanners are adequate for capturing images for computer display. Scanners usually come with software, such as Adobe's Photoshop product, that lets you resize and otherwise modify a captured image.</div><p>
<img class="side-img" src="S2.jpg.jpg">
<div><p>Scanners usually attach to your personal computer with a Small Computer System Interface ( SCSI ). An application such as PhotoShop uses the TWAIN program to read in the image.</div></p>

<div><p>Some major manufacturers of scanners include: Epson, Hewlett-Packard, Microtek, and Relisys.</p>
<p>Modern scanners typically use a charge-coupled device (CCD) or a contact image sensor (CIS) as the image sensor, whereas drum scanners, developed earlier and still used for the highest possible image quality, use a photomultiplier tube (PMT) as the image sensor. A rotary scanner, used for high-speed document scanning, is a type of drum scanner that uses a CCD array instead of a photomultiplier. Non-contact planetary scanners essentially photograph delicate books and documents. All these scanners produce two-dimensional images of subjects that are usually flat, but sometimes solid; 3D scanners produce information on the three-dimensional structure of solid objects.</div></p>
<img class="side-img" src="S3.jpg.jpg">
<div><p>Digital cameras can be used for the same purposes as dedicated scanners. When compared to a true scanner, a camera image is subject to a degree of distortion, reflections, shadows, low contrast, and blur due to camera shake (reduced in cameras with image stabilization). Resolution is sufficient for less demanding applications. Digital cameras offer advantages of speed, portability and non-contact digitizing of thick documents without damaging the book spine. In 2010 scanning technologies were combining 3D scanners with digital cameras to create full-color, photo-realistic 3D models of objects.</div></p>

<div><p>In the biomedical research area, detection devices for DNA microarrays are called scanners as well. These scanners are high-resolution systems (up to 1 Âµm/ pixel), similar to microscopes. The detection is done via CCD or a photomultiplier tubes.</div></p>
<b>There are following types of scanner are available.</b><br></center>
<ol>
<li>OCR</li><br>
<li>OMR</li><br>
<li>MICR</li><br>
<li>Barcode reader</li><br>
<li>Image Scanner</li><br>
</ol>
<center>
<div><h3>OCR</h3>
<p>Optical character recognition or optical character reader (OCR) is the electronic or mechanical conversion of images of typed, handwritten or printed text into machine-encoded text, whether from a scanned document, a photo of a document, a scene-photo (for example the text on signs and billboards in a landscape photo) or from subtitle text superimposed on an image (for example: from a television broadcast).[1]
</div></p><img class="side-img" src="OCR.jpg.jpg">
<div><p>Widely used as a form of data entry from printed paper data records â€“ whether passport documents, invoices, bank statements, computerized receipts, business cards, mail, printouts of static-data, or any suitable documentation â€“ it is a common method of digitizing printed texts so that they can be electronically edited, searched, stored more compactly, displayed on-line, and used in machine processes such as cognitive computing, machine translation, (extracted) text-to-speech, key data and text mining. OCR is a field of research in pattern recognition, artificial intelligence and computer vision.</div></p>
<img class="side-img" src="OCR2.jpg.jpg">
<div><p>Early versions needed to be trained with images of each character, and worked on one font at a time. Advanced systems capable of producing a high degree of recognition accuracy for most fonts are now common, and with support for a variety of digital image file format inputs.[2] Some systems are capable of reproducing formatted output that closely approximates the original page including images, columns, and other non-textual components.</div></p>
<div><h4>2]OMR</h4>
<p>Many OMR devices have a scanner that shines a light onto a form. The device then looks at the contrasting reflectivity of the light at certain positions on the form. It will detect the black marks because they reflect less light than the blank areas on the form./p>

<p>Some OMR devices use forms that are printed on transoptic paper. The device can then measure the amount of light that passes through the paper. It will pick up any black marks on either side of the paper because they reduce the amount of light passing through.</div></p>
<img class="side-img" src="OMR.jpg.jpg">
<div><p>In contrast to the dedicated OMR device, desktop OMR software allows a user to create their own forms in a word processor or computer and print them on a laser laser printer. The OMR software then works with a common desktop image scanner with a document feeder to process the forms once filled out.</div></p>

<div><p>OMR is generally distinguished from optical character recognition (OCR) by the fact that a complicated pattern recognition engine is not required. That is, the marks are constructed in such a way that there is little chance that the OMR device will not read them correctly. This does require the image to have high contrast and an easily recognizable or irrelevant shape. A related field to OMR and OCR is the recognition of barcodes, such as the UPC bar code found on product packaging.</div></p>

<div><p>One of the most familiar applications of OMR is the use of #2 pencil (HB in Europe) bubble optical answer sheets in multiple choice question examinations. Students mark their answers, or other personal information, by darkening circles on a forms. The sheet is then graded by a scanning machine.</div></p>
<img class="side-img" src="OMR1.jpg.jpg">
<div><p>In the United States and most European countries, a horizontal or vertical "tick" in a rectangular "lozenge" is the most commonly used type of OMR form;
The most familiar form in the United Kingdom is the UK National lottery form.[citation needed]</div></p>
<div><p>Lozenge marks represent a later technology that is easier to mark and easier to erase. The large "bubble" marks are legacy technology from very early OMR machines that were so insensitive a large mark was required for reliability. In most Asian countries, a special marker is used to fill in an optical answer sheet. Students, likewise, mark answers or other information by darkening circles marked on a pre-printed sheet. Then the sheet is automatically graded by a scanning machine.</div></p>

<div><p>Many of today's OMR applications involve people filling in specialized forms. These forms are optimized for computer scanning, with careful registration in the printing, and careful design so that ambiguity is reduced to the minimum possible. Due to its extremely low error rate, low cost and ease-of-use, OMR is a popular method of tallying votes.</div></p>

<div><p>OMR marks are also added to items of printed mail so folder inserter equipment can be used. The marks are added to each (normally facing/odd) page of a mail document and consist of a sequence of black dashes that folder inserter equipment scans in order to determine when the mail should be folded then inserted in an envelope.</div></p>
<div><h3>3]MICR</h3>
<p>Magnetic ink character recognition code, known in short as MICR code, is a character recognition technology used mainly by the banking industry to streamline the processing and clearance of cheques and other documents.</div> </p><img class="side-img" src="MICR1.jpg.jpg">
<div><p>MICR encoding, called the MICR line, is at the bottom of cheques and other vouchers and typically includes the document-type indicator, bank code, bank account number, cheque number, cheque amount (usually added after a cheque is presented for payment) and a control indicator. The format for the bank code and bank account number is country-specific.</div></p>
<img class="side-img" src="MICR.jpg.jpg">
<div><p>The technology allows MICR readers to scan and read the information directly into a data-collection device. Unlike barcode and similar technologies, MICR characters can be read easily by humans. MICR encoded documents can be processed much faster and more accurately than conventional OCR encoded documents.</div></p>
<div><h3>4]Barcode reader</h3>
 <p>Barcode reader or Barcode scanner is an electronic input device which is able to scan and decode barcodes. These devices use optical technology such as infrared light. Some readers use an integrated decoder, others have one unit for reading the barcode, and another one to decode the barcode. A barcode reader, also called a price scanner or point-of-sale ( POS ) scanner, is a hand-held or stationary input device used to capture and read information contained in a bar code . A barcode reader consists of a scanner , a decoder (either built-in or external), and a cable used to connect the reader with a computer.</div></p><img class="side-img" src="barcode.jpg.jpg"><div><p>Because a barcode reader merely captures and translates the barcode into numbers and/or letters, the data must be sent to a computer so that a software application can make sense of the data. Barcode scanners can be connected to a computer through a serial port , keyboard port , or an interface device called a wedge . A barcode reader works by directing a beam of light across the bar code and measuring the amount of light that is reflected back. The dark bars on a barcode reflect less light than the white spaces between them. The barcode scanner then converts the reflected light energy into electrical energy, which is converted into data by the decoder and forwarded to a computer.</div></p>

<img class="side-img" src="Barcode1.jpg.jpg">
<div><h4>A handheld barcode scanner</h4>
There are five basic kinds of barcode readers
</center>
<ol>
  <li>pen wands</li><br>
  <li>slot scanners</li><br>
  <li>Charge-Couple Device ( CCD )</li><br>
  <li>scanners,</li><br>
  <li>image scanners,</li><br>
  <li>laser scanners.</li><br>
  </ol>
  <center></div>
  <div>><p>A pen wand is the simplest barcode reader. It contains no moving parts and is known for its durability and low cost. A pen wand can present a challenge to the user, however, because it has to remain in direct contact with the bar code, must be held at a certain angle, and has to be moved over the bar code at a certain speed. A slot scanner remains stationary and the item with the bar code on it is pulled by hand through the slot. Slot scanners are typically used to scan bar codes on identification cards. A CCD scanner has a better read-range than the pen wand and is often used in retail sales. Typically, a CCD scanner has a "gun" type interface and has to be held no more than one inch from the bar code. Each time the bar code is scanned, several readings are taken to reduce the possibility of errors. A disadvantage of the CCD scanner is that it cannot read a bar code that is wider than its input face. </div></p><img class="side-img" src="HB.jpg.jpg"><div><p>An image scanner, also called a camera reader, uses a small video camera to capture an image of the bar code and then uses sophisticated digital image processing techniques to decode the bar code. It can read a bar code from about 3 to 9 inches away and generally costs less than a laser scanner. A laser scanner, either hand-held or stationary, does not have to be close to the bar code in order to do its job. It uses a system of mirrors and lenses to allow the scanner to read the bar code regardless of orientation, and can easily read a bar code up to 24 inches away. To reduce the possibility of errors, a laser scanning may perform up to 500 scans per second. Specialized long-range laser scanners are capable of reading a bar code up to 30 feet away.</div></p>
<div><h3>5] Image Scanner</h3>
<p>An image scannerâ€”often abbreviated to just scannerâ€”is a device that optically scans images, printed text, handwriting or an object and converts it to a digital image. Commonly used in offices are variations of the desktop flatbed scanner where the document is placed on a glass window for scanning. Hand-held scanners, where the device is moved by hand, have evolved from text scanning "wands" to 3D scanners used for industrial design, reverse engineering, test and measurement, orthotics, gaming and other applications. Mechanically driven scanners that move the document are typically used for large-format documents, where a flatbed design would be impractical.</div></p>

<img class="side-img" src="Image.jpg.jpg"><div><p>A flatbed scanner. Documents or images are placed face-down beneath the cover (shown closed here).</div></p>
<div><p>Modern scanners typically use a charge-coupled device (CCD) or a contact image sensor (CIS) as the image sensor, whereas drum scanners, developed earlier and still used for the highest possible image quality, use a photomultiplier tube (PMT) as the image sensor. A rotary scanner, used for high-speed document scanning, is a type of drum scanner that uses a CCD array instead of a photomultiplier.
